v0.2.1:

    * Fix memory leak in tnetstring.pop(); thanks tarvip.
    * Fix bug in handling of large integers; thanks gdamjan.


v0.2.0:

    * Easy loading of unicode strings.  If you pass an optional "encoding"
      argument to load/loads/pop then it will return unicode string objects
      rather than byte strings.
    * Easy dumping of unicode strings.  If you pass an optional "encoding"
      argument to dump/dumps then it will write unicode strings in that
      encoding.


v0.1.0:

    * Initial version; you might say *everything* has changed.
